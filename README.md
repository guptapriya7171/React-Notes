# React-Notes
1. In a <b> VS code sde</b>
   Create React App Command :npx create-react-app <i>my-app</i><br>
   Be careful to put everything in smallcase.
2. We can even include cdn link in our project:
   https://reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html and run the same on Vs code. </br>
   To make it possible, we need to install the Live server extension and then later press on the Go Live option in the bottom-most part of the vs code interface. 
3. <b>Redux</b>
   Redux is a tool for a state management. In react application, we have several components with their respective states. So for managing and passing those data we can take the help of redux.
   <h3>Features</h3>
   1. Redux is predictable<br>
         -- we do know from where the state is changing, why it is changing and who it is changing.<br>
   2. Easier to maintain<br>
        -- Easier to maintain because of a predefined properties.<br>
   3. Persistence of storage <br>
       -- we can prefill data in our local storage<br>
