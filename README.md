# React-Notes
1. In a <b> VS code sde</b>
   Create React App Command :npx create-react-app <i>my-app</i><br>
   Be careful to put everything in smallcase.
2. We can even include cdn link in our project:
   https://reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html and run the same on Vs code. </br>
   To make it possible, we need to install the Live server extension and then later press on the Go Live option in the bottom-most part of the vs code interface.
